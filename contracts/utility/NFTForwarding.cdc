/// ## Non-Fungible Token Forwarding Contract
///
/// This contract enables a user to designate a recipient so NFTs could be forwarded
///
/// The NFTForwarder resource can be referenced just like any NonFungibleToken Collection,
/// allowing a sender to deposit NFTs as they usually would
///
/// However, in this implementation, any time a deposit is made, the deposited NFT is
/// additionally deposited to a predefined recipient Collection.
///
/// To create an NFTForwarder resource, an account calls the createNewNFTForwarder()
/// function, passing the Collection Capability to which NFTs will be forwarded.
