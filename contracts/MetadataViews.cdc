/**

This contract implements the metadata standard proposed
in FLIP-0636.

Ref: https://github.com/onflow/flow/blob/master/flips/20210916-nft-metadata.md

Structs and resources can implement one or more
metadata types, called views. Each view type represents
a different kind of metadata, such as a creator biography
or a JPEG image file.
